{"body":"# Genesis\r\nTotoe ([Maori for \"to split, devide\"](http://www.maoridictionary.co.nz/index.cfm?dictionaryKeywords=totoe)) is a XML parser for GWT. Totoe comes with [JSONPath](http://www.sitepen.com/blog/2008/03/17/jsonpath-support/) support when parsing JSON and XPath and namespace support when parsing XML. It originated from [Pirit](https://github.com/hpehl/piriti) a JSON and XML mapper for GWT.\r\n\r\n## JSON\r\nTotoe uses [JSONPath](http://www.sitepen.com/blog/2008/03/17/jsonpath-support/) to evaluate JSONPath expressions. \r\n\r\n## XML \r\nFor the XML parsing Totoe relies on [Sarissa](http://dev.abiss.gr/sarissa/). Sarissa is a great cross browser XML parser for javascript. Essentially Totoe is a GWT port of Sarissa with the goal to offer a similar API as the GWT XML module. Right now the focus is on parsing XML - there are no methods to create, insert or append documents, elements or nodes. Those features might come in later releases. The big advantage over the GWT XML module is IMHO a cleaner API and the support of XPath and namespaces. \r\n\r\n## Features / Limitations\r\n  * Support for [JSONPath](http://www.sitepen.com/blog/2008/03/17/jsonpath-support/) expressions\r\n  * XML parser with similar API as the GWT XML module\r\n  * Support for XPath\r\n  * Namespaces support in IE7 and IE8\r\n  * Right now no support to create, insert or append documents, elements or nodes.\r\n\r\n## Totoe-Tester\r\nIf you want to take a quick look at Totoes features feel free to go to http://totoe-tester.appspot.com/. There you can enter arbitrary JSON / XML and test your XPath / JSONPath expressions.","note":"Don't delete this file!
